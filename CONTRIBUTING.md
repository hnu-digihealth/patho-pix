# PxMD

The project uses [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest/) for its development and package handling.

## Adding packages

PDM uses no `requirements.txt`.
New packages are installed using `pdm add <package>`.
If a package is only required during development use `pdm add -dG testing <package>`.

## Available commands

- `pdm test`:
  - installs the project
  - runs all tests in `tests`
- `pdm lint`:
  - runs flake8 on `src/wsi2brick` and `tests`
- `cov_report`:
  - runs pytest (without installation of the project)
  - generates an coverage report
  - shows the coverage report
- `pdm check-pre-commit`
  - manually runs all pre-commit scripts to check if a commit is possible
- `pdm sort`
  - runs isort on `tests` and `src`
  - only checks for order and does not modify files
- `pdm apply_sort`
  - runs isort on `tests` and `src`
  - updates imports as required

## Virtual Environment

The virtual environment is created as part of pdm. It can be activated using `source .venv/bin/activate`.

In most cases, this is not required and all commands can simply be run with `pdm run ...`.

## Pre-Commit Hooks

This repository uses pre-commit hooks to run some workflows before committing to GitHub. This aims to increase code quality and reduce the number of failed action runs in the repository.

Run `pdm run pre-commit install` initially to enable the pre-commit script on commits.

Afterwards, all files can be checked with `pdm run check_pre_commit`.
